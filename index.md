## Hauss Media Labs is a scam

This is a scam. It is not a high end speaker brand. It is a Chinese knockoff. Worthless $0

Haus Media Labs HS-7 HS7 are Chinese junk speakers. They are NOT worth $100's or $1000's that the scammer is suggesting. AVOID

### Hauss Media Labs speakers are WORTHLESS

Don't throw away your money on junk thinking you are getting a good deal.

These Chinese versions are made with cheap and dangerous materials.

## The Speakers are known to start on fire!

The reason you cannot find any other information about it besides a FAKE brand website is because these are knock offs. They create a fake brand website to trick you into thinking it is legit. This is FAKE!
